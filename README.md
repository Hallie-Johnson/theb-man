### üéØ Game Guide
- Upon entering the game, you must **complete all tutorial levels** to unlock the main levels. If you need help in any level, you can pause the game and click the *Help* button to get level information.
- **THE B-WRANG Guide**
    - Objective: Avoid losing your health and survive the waves of enemies. If you run out of stamina by sprinting and/or punching, Bahaman will need to rest and will be vulnerable to attacks until his stamina is restored.
    - Controls:
        - **[W]** - Jump
        - **[D]** - Move Left
        - **[A]** - Move Right
        - **[SHIFT] + [A] or [D]** - Sprint
        - **[LEFT MOUSE BUTTON - LMB]** - Punch
        - **[RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON - RMB] + [Aim with Mouse]** - Throw THE B-WRANG
    - Hazards:
        - **Joker Juul Fighter Bot**: Deals *medium* damage to the player upon collision.
        - **Joker Juul Ranged Bot**: *Fires projectiles* at the player and deals damage upon collision.
        - **Joker Juul Tank Bot**: Deals *high* damage to the player upon collision.
    - Pickups:
        - **Caillois Clues**: Collect a maximum of 3 in each level to upgrade Bahaman.
    - Tips:
        - **Upgrades Count**: THE B-WRANGs do not decrease your stamina and still cause damage. Prioritize upgrading THE B-WRANG count.
- **THE B-MOBILE Guide**
    - Objective: Dodge Abt Traps and obstacles and get to Abtwoman. Abt Traps, which look like an 'X' will deplete your health. Traffic cones are obstacles that will reduce your distance to Abtwoman. You must use your boost to reach Abtwoman in time.
    - Controls:
        - **[W]** - Move Up
        - **[S]** - Move Down
        - **[SHIFT]** - Boost
    - Hazards:
        - **Traffic Cones**: Increases the distance between the THE B-MOBILE and Abtwoman, but *does not* deal any health damage.
        - **Abt Traps**: Decreases the THE B-MOBILE's health, but *does not* affect distance from the THE B-MOBILE to Abtwoman.
    - Pickups:
        - **Caillois Clues**: Collect a maximum of 3 in each level to upgrade the THE B-MOBILE.
        - **Boost**: Collect boost pickups to replenish boost.
    - Tips:
        - **Consider the Consequences**: Driving can become difficult with faster speeds. Consider the options of hitting a traffic cone versus hitting an Abt Trap. If you are low on health, hit a traffic cone. If you are high on health, hit an Abt Trap.
        - **Do Not Follow the Leader**: When Abtwoman is in sight, do not follow her movements. She will avoid traffic cones, but not Abt Traps, thus following her exactly might result in hitting Abt Traps and losing health.
        - **Center Field**: When switching lanes, try to get back to the center lane to easily avoid hazards.
        - **Boost Carefully**: It's fun to boost, but boosting into to many obstacles will hinder progress. Boost when you feel safe to do so, not just because you can.
- **THE B-WING Guide**
    - Objective: Eliminate all enemies within the timeframe. When boosting, you cannot move up down due to the high speed of the THE B-WING. Upon getting defeated, enemies will drop power ups to restore your boost and health. In order to fire at enemies, the player will need to face the enemy in order to shoot as the THE B-WING cannot shoot targets behind itself.
    - Controls:
        - **[W]** - Move Up
        - **[S]** - Move Down
        - **[A]** - Move Right
        - **[D]** - Move Left

    - Hazards:
        - **Frost Fighter**: *Fires projectiles* at the player and causes damage to the THE B-WING upon collision.

        - **Boost**: Collect boost pickups to replenish boost.
        - **Health**: Collect health pickups to replenish health.
    - Tips:
        - **Slow and Steady**: Going fast is great to reach enemies within the timeframe, but take it slow when in combat to aim better.
        - **Ready, Aim, Fire**: Make sure to face the enemy to fire. The THE B-WING cannot fire at enemies behind itself.
